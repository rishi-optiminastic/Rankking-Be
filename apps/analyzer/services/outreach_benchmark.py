"""The outreach benchmark — a deliberately small analysis, built to be pasted
into a cold email.

Sales outreach needs three things, and only three: the buyer prompts a prospect
is losing, who AI engines recommend instead, and a short list of what to do.
The full pipeline answers far more than that, takes 10-20 minutes, and costs
$0.30-$3 a run because it fans every prompt across seven answer engines with
web search on. Most of that work never reaches the email.

So this profile keeps the one part that cannot be faked — really asking answer
engines the question and recording what they say — and drops everything else.
Three engines instead of seven and six prompts instead of ten put a run at
roughly $0.20, which is affordable per prospect.

The measurement stays real on purpose. A cheap model writes the prompts and the
opportunity text, but nothing here ever *predicts* what an engine would answer:
a fabricated benchmark is worse than none, because it is sent to a named person
who can check it in thirty seconds.
