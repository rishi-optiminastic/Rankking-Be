"""Who may touch which org, run and task — the analyzer app's scoping seam.

Analyzer views historically resolved scope from a client-supplied ``?email=`` or
``org_id``, then either checked nothing or checked that value against itself. Two
consequences, both verified against a live test database:

- ``org_id`` is ``Organization``'s sequential integer PK, so ``org_id=1,2,3…``
  walked every tenant. ``Organization.slug`` exists precisely because the PK is
  guessable ("Unguessable public identifier", see organizations.models) — the
  analyzer endpoints just never used it.
- ``UserAction`` rows were fetched by integer id with no ownership check at all,
  so an anonymous caller could flip another account's task to VERIFIED, inject
  ``notes`` and award that account points.

Identity comes from ``core.auth.identity.resolve_request_email``: a verified
better-auth JWT when the frontend sends one, else the legacy ``email`` field
until ``REQUIRE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY`` is switched on. The helpers here take that
*resolved* email and answer the authorization question.

Note what this does and does not close while enforcement is off. Requiring
ownership removes integer-PK enumeration outright — an attacker must now know the
victim's address rather than count from 1. It does not stop someone who knows an
address from claiming it; only flipping ``REQUIRE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY`` does that,
and routing every call site through this module is what makes that one-line
change sufficient.

Agencies are why this is not a plain ``owner_email ==`` comparison: a member acts
on the brands their agency owns, so access is the union of the caller's own orgs
and their agency's.
