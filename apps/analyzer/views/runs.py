    POST /api/analyzer/onboarding-start/

    Mints a short-lived signed token (~15 min) that downstream public AI
    endpoints (currently /generate-prompts/) require in the
    ``X-Onboarding-Token`` header.

    Body (optional):
      { "turnstile_token": "<cf turnstile response>" }  # accepted, not verified

    **Turnstile is currently disabled.** ``onboarding_security.turnstile_enabled``
    returns False unconditionally - the Cloudflare check was removed - so
    ``turnstile_token`` is accepted and ignored, and ``turnstile_enabled`` in the
    response is always False. Setting ``TURNSTILE_SECRET`` does *not* re-enable
    it; that function has to change first. The docstring previously claimed the
    opposite, which read as bot protection that is not actually running.

    What does defend this endpoint today: the global IP middleware plus this
    throttle. That still breaks rotating-IP wallet-drain on /generate-prompts,
    because each fresh IP must round-trip here first (heavily throttled) - but
    it is IP-based only, with no proof-of-humanity.
