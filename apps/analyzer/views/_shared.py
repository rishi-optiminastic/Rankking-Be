    A run slug is unguessable but it is not a credential: it travels in browser
    history, support tickets and analytics tooling. The goal is that holding one
    never grants a third party the brand's data.

    Three cases, in order:

    1. **Verified caller** - identity comes from ``request.user``, which
       ``BetterAuthJWTAuthentication`` sets only after verifying a signed JWT.
       Ownership is re-derived from server records and a mismatch is 404, not
       403: a 403 confirms the run exists to someone who should not know that.
    2. **No identity and ``REQUIRE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY`` is on** - refused.
    3. **No identity and the flag is off** - the slug admits, which is the
       convention the other ~78 run-scoped endpoints already follow.

    Case 3 is a deliberate, temporary concession and the reason is worth stating
    plainly. This gate previously failed closed for everyone. Shipped against a
    deployment where ``BETTER_AUTH_JWKS_URL`` is unset *and* the frontend sends
    cookies rather than a Bearer token, that meant **no caller could ever
    authenticate**, and six features returned 503 to every user. Failing closed
    on an authentication path that does not exist yet is not a security control,
    it is an outage.

    Case 1 is the part that is kept, and it is not nothing: a signed-in customer
    can no longer read another brand's run by pasting its slug. Flipping
    ``REQUIRE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY`` closes case 3 for every endpoint here at once,
    which is the intended end state once better-auth's JWT plugin is enabled and
    the frontend attaches the token.
