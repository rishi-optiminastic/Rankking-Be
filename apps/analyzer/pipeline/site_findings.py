"""Open-ended site audit: findings discovered by reading the site, not matched
against a fixed rule list.

``pipeline/recommendations.py`` holds 83 hand-written rules. Each one is a real
deterministic check and they stay: measuring "this page has no h1" is better done
by a parser than by a model. But a rule engine can only ever report problems
somebody wrote a checker for, which is why every customer's task list looked like
the same SEO checklist.

This module is the other half. It reads the pages actually crawled for the run
and reports what is wrong with *this* site, including the class of issue no
generic rule can express - most notably pages of the same kind built
inconsistently (a guide page that lacks the structure its sibling blog posts
have).

**The anti-hallucination gate is the point of this module.** An LLM asked to
"find problems" will happily invent them. So every finding must carry a verbatim
quote from a crawled page, and ``_verify_evidence`` checks that quote against the
page text before the finding survives. Findings whose evidence cannot be located
are dropped and logged. This is the same contract used elsewhere in the pipeline:
a claim we cannot ground is discarded, never shown.
