"""
The fix agent: a bounded tool-loop that turns ONE analyzer finding into a set of
file edits for a connected repo. The LLM (routed via model_routing's "fix_agent"
task, so the model is one env var away from a swap) gets
read-only repo tools — list_tree / read_file / search_code — explores until it
knows what to change, then calls propose_changes (full file contents) or
cannot_fix. Pure validation guards reject unsafe patches.

The result feeds the existing orchestrator (branch + commit + PR). Generation is
deliberately read-only here; nothing is written to GitHub from this module.
