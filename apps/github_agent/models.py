"""
Models for the GitHub Agent — the autonomous GEO fixer.

The agent's "memory" lives here, not in the LLM: an installation records which
repo we're connected to (keyed back to an AnalysisRun + Organization), and every
fix attempt is a GithubFixJob row (one per PR). On each action the orchestrator
re-assembles context from these rows + the analyzer's Recommendation rows, so
nothing depends on model memory and a restart loses nothing.
