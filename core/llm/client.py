"""
Unified LLM client using OpenRouter.

Two distinct model sets live here, and conflating them is a bug:

* ``MODELS`` — **internal workers.** They summarise crawled pages, pick
  competitors, draft copy. Chosen for cost; they never need world knowledge,
  because whatever they reason about is already in the prompt.
* ``ANSWER_ENGINES`` — **answer-engine simulation.** Used by prompt tracking,
  rank tracking and visibility probes to reproduce what a real user sees when
  they ask ChatGPT or Gemini something. These run with web search on.

Falls back to direct Gemini API if no OpenRouter key (internal work only —
answer-engine simulation requires OpenRouter for web search).

    This is what prompt tracking and visibility probes must use. Unlike
    ``ask_multiple_llms_with_citations`` it resolves models from
    ``ANSWER_ENGINES`` rather than ``MODELS``, turns on the web plugin, and
    disables cross-vendor fallback so an engine's answer is always genuinely
    that engine's answer. An engine that fails yields an empty string, which
    the caller records as "no answer" rather than silently substituting another
    model's response under the wrong label.

    Note for callers weighing cost: the engine is asked the buyer question ALONE.
    The brand is never part of the query — it is matched against the reply
    afterwards — so the answer to "best tools for X" is the same text whoever
    asked. That is what makes the reply cacheable across brands; see
    ``prompt_tracker.fire_prompt_across_engines(cache_ttl=...)``, which owns that
    cache because it lives in the Django app and this module stays framework-free.
