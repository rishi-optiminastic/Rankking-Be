"""Send work to a queue by task NAME, without importing the task.

``workers/`` sits above the apps: a worker binds an app's service to celery, so
the app must not import the worker back. Four call sites did
(``from workers.analysis.tasks import run_analysis_task``), which is an upward
edge the layering contract rejects.

Dispatching by name removes it. Every task in this codebase already pins an
explicit ``name=`` (``analyzer.run_analysis`` etc.), so ``send_task`` reaches it
through the broker with no Python import at all.

Two brokers, because there are two celery apps:

- ``ANALYSIS`` - the RabbitMQ app (``config.celery_rabbit``) that owns the
  analysis pipeline.
- ``DEFAULT``  - the Redis app (``config.celery``) that owns the sitemap audit.

``is_eager`` is exposed because callers legitimately branch on it: with no broker
configured (local dev, tests) celery runs tasks in-process, and several call
sites deliberately run inline or on a thread instead so an HTTP response is not
blocked by a full crawl. That decision stays with the caller; only the import
moves here.
